    <p>You follow Claudius as he flees. When you catch up with him, he is alone, but he's praying. You hesitate to kill him, fearing that he will die a forgiven man if killed while praying. You want him to die with a guilty conscience.</p>
        <h1>What do you do?</h1>
    <p><a href="leavehim.html" style="font-size: 35px" >
        Leave him be. You'll think of another way to get him alone later.
      </a></p>

      <p><a href="killhim.html" style="font-size: 35px" >
        Kill him anyway. This may be your only chance.
      </a></p>
