    <p>You decide to leave Claudius alone for the time being. Revenge wouldn't be as sweet if your uncle has confessed his sins to God.

        Instead you decide to go confront your mother in her bedchamber. While there, you think you see the ghost of your father again, and you feel yourself starting to panic. Suddenly you hear a noise behind the curtain. You still have your knife.</p>
    <h1>What do you do?</h1>
    <p><a href="Blindyl.html" style="font-size: 35px" >
        Blindly stab behind the curtain, hoping it's Claudius.
      </a></p>

      <p><a href="runfrom.html" style="font-size: 35px" >
        Run from the chamber.
      </a></p>
