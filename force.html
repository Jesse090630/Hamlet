    <p>You stab Claudius with the poisoned sword. As he collapses, you tackle him and force him to drink the tainted wine, for good measure.
        He quickly dies. Your vengeance is complete.
        
        However, Laertes' poison is working quickly. You collapse and crawl over to Horatio, who embraces you as you die.
        
        "And the rest is silence."
        (Hamlet, Act 5, Scene 2, Line 358)
        
        "Now cracks a noble heart. Good night, sweet prince,
        And flights of angels sing thee to thy rest!"
        (Hamlet, Act 5, Scene 2, Lines 359-60)</p>
