    <p>Despite hearing your mother collapse behind you, you decide to keep fighting. You are not going to give Laertes any opportunity to get the upper hand.

        As the fight continues, Laertes lands a hit on you, slicing through your shirt and cutting you. As the fight continues, the two of you somehow switch swords. After a few spars, you land another, more violent hit on Laertes.
        
        After a few moments, he, too, collapses. As he lies on the ground in agony, he reveals that Claudius poisoned the wine in an attempt to kill you. Claudius is responsible for your mother's death. Laertes also admits that he poisoned his own blade in order to exact his own vengeance, but he has now succumbed to his own treachery. After revealing this information, he dies.
        
        Wounded, bleeding, and poisoned, you turn on Claudius.</p>
    <h1>What do you do?</h1>
