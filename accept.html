    <p>You accept the challenge and return to the castle. The fencing duel is scheduled for later that night.

        You sit with Horatio before the duel, preparing to take on Laertes. Finally, the moment comes, and you are escorted to the throne room. It is decided that the first man to get three hits on his opponent will win the match.
        
        The duel begins. You land the first hit, and Claudius offers you a drink of wine from a goblet.</p>

        Take a sip. You're parched.
