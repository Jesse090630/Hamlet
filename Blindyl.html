    <p>You let your anger and fear get the best of you and blindly stab the curtain. You hope it was Claudius who made the noise, and you think this could be your new opportunity for revenge.

        It was Polonius. You have fatally wounded him, and he is dead by the time you pull back the curtain. You flee with the body and bury it.
        
        You find out the next morning that Claudius has sentenced you to immediate exile in England as punishment for your deed. You will be accompanied by Rosencrantz and Guildenstern to ensure you arrive in England.
        
        While on the boat bound for exile, you find a letter from Claudius to the King of England hidden in Rosencrantz's things.</p>
    <h1>What do you do?</h1>
    <p><a href="return.html" style="font-size: 35px" >
        Return the letter to where you found it. It's probably just instructions telling the King to not let you return to Denmark.
      </a></p>

      <p><a href="open.html" style="font-size: 35px" >
        Open the letter and read it.
      </a></p>
