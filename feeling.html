    <p>You go with your gut instinct and keep up your charade. You end up yelling at Ophelia, telling her that you wish to ban marriage and that she should go to a nunnery. She seems upset, so you leave.

        Eventually, you find out that there is a troupe of actors coming to the castle. You realize they could be a valuable tool to you.</p>
    <h1>What do you do now?</h1>
    <p><a href="enlist.html" style="font-size: 35px" >
        Enlist their help in exposing your uncle's treachery using a play you create.
      </a></p>

      <p><a href="decide.html" style="font-size: 35px" >
        Decide they probably wouldn't help you anyway and simply enjoy the play they choose to perform.
      </a></p>
