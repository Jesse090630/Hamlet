    <p>This betrayal calls for revenge. You develop a plan to get back at all parties involved.

        You throw away Claudius' letter and write your own, instructing the King of England to kill Rosencrantz and Guildenstern instead. You decide to somehow make your way back to Denmark, when your ship is attacked by bandits.</p>

    <h1>What do you do?</h1>
    <p><a href="jump.html" style="font-size: 35px" >
        Jump ship and join the bandits, bribing them into taking you back to Denmark.
      </a></p>

      <p><a href="Hide.html" style="font-size: 35px" >
        Hide among the ship's cargo and continue to England. You'll find another way back yourself.
      </a></p>
