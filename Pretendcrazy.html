    <p>You opt to fake insanity, which works to keep Claudius and your mother home, since they are now concerned for you. The plan seems to be progressing well when two other friends from school, Rosencrantz and Guildenstern, show up to the castle. They're acting strangely, and you begin to suspect that they were sent by Claudius and your mother. The only question is, are they here to comfort you? Or to spy?</p>
    <h1>How do you respond to them?</h1>

        Trust them and let them in on your plan. They're your friends, after all.
      </a></p>

        Distrust them and continue acting crazy. They're probably working for Claudius.
