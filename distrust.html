    <p>You decide that you can no longer trust your friends. After all, you don't know what their motivations are, and they were sent by your (apparently treacherous) uncle. You decide to continue the insanity act. This works for a while. Eventually, you find yourself alone with Ophelia, Polonius' daughter, whom you used to have some feelings for. She still has a crush on you.

        She's acting odd, and not in the "I-have-a-crush-on-you-and-I-don't-know-how-to-act" way. She keeps asking you random, but specific questions regarding your madness. You suspect that she, too, has been sent to spy on you.</p>
    <h1>What do you do?</h1>
    <p><a href="brush.html" style="font-size: 35px" >
        Brush off the feeling and be nice to her. She's done nothing wrong, after all.
      </a></p>

      <p><a href="feeling.html" style="font-size: 35px" >
        Trust the feeling and keep acting mad.
      </a></p>
