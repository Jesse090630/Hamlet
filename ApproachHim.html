    <p>Fearfully, you approach the apparition. After a moment, it begins to speak to you. It tells you that it is, indeed, your father, and that he was murdered by Claudius. He demands that you take revenge on the man who killed him and married his wife, your mother. Then, the ghost disappears.</p>
