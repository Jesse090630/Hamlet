    <p>You refuse the wine. It would just be a waste of time, and you want to finish this fight as quickly as possible.

        You recall Laertes to the fight, and the duel resumes.
        
        Your mother, however, decides to drink the wine. After a few moments, she collapses, dead.</p>
    <h1>How do you react?</h1>
    <p><a href="side.html" style="font-size: 35px" >
        You run to her side. She's your mother after all.
      </a></p>

      <p><a href="kepp.html" style="font-size: 35px" >
        You keep fighting. If you turn your back, your a goner.
      </a></p>
