    <p>Your plan works! You are on your way back to Denmark. You decide to send a letter to Horatio, asking him to meet you upon your arrival. You also send one to Claudius, telling him that his plan failed and you are coming back for revenge.

        When you arrive back in Denmark, you walk back to the castle with Horatio. On the journey, you end up in a cemetery and speak with a gravedigger. While there, you see a funeral procession approaching.
        
        You quickly realize the funeral is Ophelia's. You and Horatio hide, listening in on what is happening. You discover that Ophelia has committed suicide, most likely due to the death of her father, Polonius, and your spurning of her. Overcome with emotion, you jump into her grave and cradle her body. Laertes, Ophelia's brother, challenges you to a duel.</p>
    <h1>How do you respond?</h1>
    <p><a href="accept.html" style="font-size: 35px" >
        Accept the challenge. A true man never backs down from a fight.
      </a></p>

      <p><a href="refuse.html" style="font-size: 35px" >
        Refuse the challenge. You're at a funeral, after all. This isn't the time or place.
